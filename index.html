            <p>Hi, I'm Senamile, a third-year student at Mangosuthu University, pursuing a degree in Information and Communication Technology with a focus on programming. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in various programming languages and technologies, and I am passionate about applying this knowledge to real-world challenges. I have a particular interest in software development, web development, and data analysis, and I am always eager to learn and explore new technologies that enhance my skill set. My coursework and personal projects have provided me with hands-on experience in coding, problem-solving, and creating innovative solutions. Beyond my studies, I enjoy participating in tech-related activities, such as coding challenges and hackathons, which allow me to further develop my skills and connect with like-minded individuals. I'm excited to continue growing my expertise and contributing to the ever-evolving field of technology.

                <p>In this project, I developed a fully functional calculator using [specify the programming language or framework, e.g., HTML, CSS, and JavaScript]. The video demonstrates the calculator's capabilities, including basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project allowed me to apply my programming skills in a practical way, enhancing my understanding of user interface design, event handling, and logic implementation. By creating this calculator, I gained valuable experience in problem-solving and software development, which I look forward to applying in more complex projects.</p>
